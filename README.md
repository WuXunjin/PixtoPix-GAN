# PixtoPix-GAN

<h2>Dataset</h2>
In this project, I use the maps dataset 
used in the Pix2Pix paper. This is a
dataset comprised of satellite images of New York and their 
corresponding Google maps pages.
The image translation problem involves converting 
satellite photos to Google maps format, or
the reverse, Google maps images to Satellite photos. 

<h2>Model</h2>
Pix2pix is a variant of the conditional GAN.Pix2pix is a type of GAN that is capable of performing image-to-image
translation using the unsupervised method of machine learning
(ML). Once trained, pix2pix can translate an image from domain A to
domain B.
